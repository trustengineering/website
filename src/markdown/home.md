### Honesty

Creating short feedback loops help us to develop any solutions we create. It is vital that any feedback we receive or give is beneficial to meeting the goals we are trying to achieve. Likewise, it is essential that we can form honest relationships, be honest and work every day on the basis that what everyone is honest with us.
