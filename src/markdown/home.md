## Our core values

### Simplicity

At Trust Engineering we maintain simplicity through basic technique, simple terminology, and repeatable recipes. In light of this, our clients benefit from the simple solutions we provide. Simple solutions allow easy on-boarding, the ability to pivot quickly and increased agility.  

### Honesty

Creating short feedback loops help us to develop any solutions we create. It is vital that any feedback we receive or give is beneficial to meeting the goals we are trying to achieve. Likewise, it is essential that we can form honest relationships, be honest and work every day on the basis that what everyone is honest with us.   

### Openness

Creating software in a closed environment suppresses innovation, restrains the pace of development and over-complicates solutions. We embrace open source software and the practices that correspond to it.
