Lewis' experience is a mix of user experience design, software engineering and lean, and agile, product development.

He began building and designing software products commercially during the dot-com boom, after co-founding a web agency in the late nineteen nineties. Since then he's worked with digital agencies, software consultancies, investment banks, investment managers, multi national media companies, insurance companies and high street retailers, helping to deliver web software at scale.
